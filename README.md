# Weather-App

A basic weather app made with [React-Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) and [Open Weather Api](https://openweathermap.org/)

## How to Use

Upon entering the name of a city, the application communicates with the Open Weather API to fetch the latest weather data for that location. It then displays this information in an easily digestible format for the user.
